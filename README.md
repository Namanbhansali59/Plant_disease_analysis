# 🌿 Plant Disease Analysis – Power BI + PostgreSQL

Analyze how environmental conditions like temperature, humidity, rainfall, and soil pH influence plant disease occurrence.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- PostgreSQL (SQL database & queries)
- Power BI (Data visualization)
- DAX (KPI Measures)
- CSV Dataset (10,000 rows)

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Disease more frequent with **low rainfall & acidic pH**.
- Higher **temperature** doesn't always imply disease.
- **Slicers** enable exploring specific environmental conditions.

## 📌 How to Use
1. Run the SQL script to create the database & import data
2. Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI
3. Connect to your PostgreSQL DB (or use imported data)
4. Explore the visuals interactively
